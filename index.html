							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
						I am writing regarding my interest in Southwest Airlines’ Jr. Technology Associate role. As a technologist working for T-Mobile over five years, I have gained a diverse set of skills through my experience working as a Mobile Expert, Integration Specialist, Service Desk Specialist, and Early in Career Software Engineer. The latter role consisted of attending a Full-Stack Java bootcamp, before joining T-Mobile’s Data Protection and Privacy team. There I partnered with the team lead and architect to identify business needs during a sprint to either apply my existing knowledge, or leverage my ability to learn new skills, to develop a solution.  I have obtained professional certifications in computer hardware/OS, networks, project management, cybersecurity, and IT support, which I  believe make me a useful asset to your information technology team. I am in my final year of my Bachelor of Science degree in Cybersecurity, which introduced me to software development and database management. In addition to my technical experience, I also have leadership experience from participating in T-Mobile’s L.E.A.D. program, hosting developmental trainings for integration specialists, and serving as the point of contact to onboard new engineers to the app onboarding and testing framework projects.
						</p>	
						
						<p>
						Based on my past experiences, I believe I would be suitable for this position because of my ability to adapt
						and learn quickly, along with my ability to work well on a team. The Jr. Technology Associate position represents the opportunity to leverage my past experiences and skill sets so I can further grow as an individual to add significant value to Southwest Airlines as a company. I am very excited about the opportunity to join your team and would be thrilled to hear back from you!
